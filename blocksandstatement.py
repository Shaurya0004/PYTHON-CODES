print("hello world") # this is one statement
x = 10 # this is another statement
# In python any piece of code which is in one single line and is executable becomes one statement

# Doubt 1 ? -> Can we have two print statements in one line ???
# print("hello") print("world") -> this gives an error

# In python also we can use ; or , to terminate a statement but it's not recommended
print("hello"); print("world")

print("hello") , print("world")


# Q -> What are blocks ->  set of multiple statement
x = 10
y = x + 2
print(y**x)

# the line 1,2,9,11,15,16 17 can be considered as a block
