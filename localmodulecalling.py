import fib#this means that tou are importing a module named a 
#          fib from the system.now in doing importing what it basically
#          do is that it will run that file.now in this case we just imported
#          it and not called for any task or function to be performed so it will
#          simply skip that function part for now only and then proceed in that 
#          fib.py file..as there is a print statement there ,it will simply print 
#          that.  

print(fib.fibonacci(5))#here we called the function fibonacci whuch is present in 
#                       module fib ,so it will simply just run that function and 
#                       print the returned value ....
